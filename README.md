Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
    This is the systematic application of Engineering principles, methods & tools to the development & maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
    Software Engineering involves the systematic application of Engineering principles , methods & tools to the development & maintenance of high quality software systems.
    SDLC is the steps taken to making any type software products while Software Engineering involves everything that is used to make the software products like what you're taught, the tools used like programming languages, computer or mobile phone.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
    Requirements - involves documentation and gathering of systems requirements and user needs
    Design - involves creating high level & detailed designs of software architecture & user interface
    Implementation - involves the actual writing of code on computer & building the software according to design specifications
    Testing - involves conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standards & functional requirements
    Deployment - involves releasing the software to customers.
    Maintenance - involves providing on-going updates, support & enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
    Waterfall model is a type of software development methodology where a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall is taken in software development.
    Agile model is a type of software development methodology where an iterative and incremental approach that is focused on flexibility, collaboration & responding to change is taken in software development.
    Differences - Waterfall model follows a sequential approach while agile model follows an iterative and incremental approach
    -Waterfall model is a less flexible approach compared to agile that is a highly flexible approach.
    -Agile model can easily respond to change depending on customer requirements while waterfall model has limited interaction with the customers hence, limited to change.
    Scenarios - where you are making applications that need customer feedback (agile)
    - where you're creating software needed for the short-term to define an outcome.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
    Requirements engineering is a phase in the software development life cycle that involves the gathering and documentation of system requirements and user needs.
    It helps Software Engineers know what is needed of the software and the objectives that the software should fulfill so as to fully plan on how the task of writing the software will be done. 

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
    Modularity in software design is the dividing or breaking down of a software system into smaller units called modules to each perform a specific function
    How it improves maintainability - it enables easier updates of software as it does not require the whole system to be updated
    - it enables simplified testing and debugging of code.
    - it enables easier understanding of code.
    How it improves scalability - it enables better management of resources without impacting other parts of the system
    - break down of the system into modules also leads to sharing of the load to different modules hence balancing it and improving system performance
    - it makes it easier to manage large-scale projects since different teams work on different modules simultaneously

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
    Testing is crucial because it helps ensure the software meets quality standards & functional requirements before being deployed to customers.
    Unit Testing - is a type of software testing where specific individual modules of the software are tested to ensure that each part is running correctly
    Integration testing - is a type of software testing where integrated modules are tested to ensure they function correctly as programmed
    System testing - is a type of software testing where the whole software system is tested to ensure it runs in compliance with the quality and system specifications
    Acceptance testing - is a type of software testing where it's tested to ensure its validation with organization requirements to make sure the software is ready for deployment

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
    Version Control Systems are the tools that help manage changes to source code and other collections of files over time
    Examples - Git, Github, Mercurial
    Importance - it enables collaboration among many software developers, leading to emergence of quality software products
    - it stores code. This enables backup and recovery of code in case issues arise when trying to access using a specific device

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
    Software Project Managers are responsible for overseeing the planning, execution & delivery of software projects.
    Responsibilities - a software developer is responsible for the writing of code and implementing software solutions.
    - a Quality Assuarance Engineer ensures software quality by designing & executing test plans.
    - a Project Manager oversees planning, execution & delivery of software projects.
    - a Systems Architect designs the overall structure & architecture of software systems.
    - a User Interface Designer creates user inerfaces & designs user experiences for software applications.
    Challenges - Tight deadlines can result in rushed development & compromised quality.
    - Changing software system requirements can lead to project delays.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
    Software maintenance is the ongoing support, updating & enhancements made to software after deployment
    Types - Preventive maintenance that involves maintenance activities for preventing future issues within the software
    - Adaptive maintenance that involves maintenance activities to enable it be functional under different circumstances
    - Corrective maintenance that involves maintenance activities to correct issues that have made the software undergo failure
    Importance - it enables adptation to different circumstances
    - it ensures high software performance
    - it helps in prolonging lifespan of the software
    - it helps in ensuring user satisfaction with software from feedback

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
    -Privacy concerns, Misinformation, Bias amplification, Transparency & honesty
    How to ensure ethical standards - by maintaining transparency and honesty with stakeholders and their customers
    - by making software systems that comply with the required security systems to keep private data safe
    - by adhering to code of ethics
    - engaging in ethical and regulatory developments
